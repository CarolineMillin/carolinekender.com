                <p>The light filters in through the window and dissipates softly around her.
                At the table, her cozy sweater is illuminated and she takes a sip of fresh coffee,
                typing away at her computer. He comes up behind her and wraps his arms around her torso, leaning his face into hers and nibbling at her ear.
                  <br>
                <br>“Cut it out” She squeaks, curling into his playful embrace as he smiles and presses his lips to hers.
                “Seriously, I’m – trying to – work!” she protests between kisses.
                He kisses the top of her head and slides next to her with his computer. “Mind if I join you?”
                  <br>
                <br>“I don’t know, I might get distracted” She smirks, turning back to her screen but leaning her shoulder against his.
                  <br>
                <br>“Here,” He turns. “Sit sideways to you can put your feet up on my lap.”
                She happily obliges, poking his stomach with her toes until he begins to tickle them.
                They reach an unspoken truce and settle into position.
                He runs his hand absentmindedly across her shins and cuddles her fuzzy-socked feet as the two of them work,
                warm in their first shared apartment on this wintry Sunday morning.

                <h3 class="mb-1">Poem For Boston</h3>
                <p class="date mb-2"> April 17, 2013</p>
                <p>If you watched these attacks from space,
                <br>they would seem so small.
                <br>Imperfections on a beautiful face,
                <br>you might not see them at all.
                  <br>
                <br>But the repercussions are relentless,
                <br>and once the shockwaves start,
                <br>smoke stings the blindest eyes of justice,
                <br>the shrapnel cuts every heart.
                  <br>
                <br>Because sadness shakes the strongest will,
                <br>fear cuts the thickest skin.
                <br>The despair spurs it deeper still,
                <br>and anger drives it in.
                  <br>
                <br>So the world cries out that it's not right,
                <br>hate throws salt on the wounds.
                <br>As darkness seems to trump the light,
                <br>and the forecast spells our doom.
                  <br>
                <br>Yet bravery cleans the salty maw,
                <br>and kindness curbs the pain;
                <br>the selflessness of those who saw
                <br>their efforts not in vain.
                  <br>
                <br>For heros are not just the grand,
                <br>who save the lives of masses;
                <br>they're those who lend their own two hands
                <br>when the world around them crashes.
                  <br>
                <br>Too many times we're filled with hate
                <br>at those who break our stride.
                <br>Too many times we must placate
                <br>the families of those who died.
                  <br>
                <br>So though patriotism springs aplenty,
                <br>a shame it must be done:
                <br>Why it always takes the loss of many
                <br>to make us feel like one.
                  <br>
                  <br>
